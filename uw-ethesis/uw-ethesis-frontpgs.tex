\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}

Property graph model is a popular semantic rich model for real-world applications concerning graph structure data, like social networks, financial transaction networks and ect. On-Line Analytical Processing(OLAP) provides an important tool for data analyses by allowing users to perform data aggregation through different combinations of dimentions. For instance, over a Q\&A forum dataset, in order to study if there is a correlation between age and post quality,one may ask what is the average user's age group by post score. In the field of music industry, we may process a query like what is total sales of records with respect to music company and year to study market activities.

State-of-art graph databases like neo4j do not have efficient support for OLAP aggregation queries. Neo4j processes each OLAP query in two steps. First expands nodes and edges to the query structure, and then perform aggregation. Even if a query is repeatedly executed for multiple times, in each round Neo4j still processes the query from scratch, without caching any structure-wise ``knowledge'' from previous workload. When it comes to large property graphs, current graph databases' efficiency is far from satisfaction. It is unacceptable for users to wait for hours for a single query to return. 

We implement a prototype system upon Neo4j that greatly improves efficiency of OLAP over large property graphs. The idea is to smartly materialize some views computed based on previous workload. Such materialization can be used to accelerate future query processing.  

We implemented our system on top of Neo4j and compared our system with orginal Neo4j system. Based on an empirical study over real-world property graph dataset, result shows that, with an acceptable cost of memory or disk usage, our solution achieves 10-30x improvement in time efficiency for OLAP queries.
